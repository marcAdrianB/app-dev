葬送のフリーレン (Sousou no Frieren) or Frieren: Beyond Journey's End tells the story of Frieren, an elven mage that has already lived for more than a thousand years. She had the chance to fight and travel together with Himmel the Hero, Eisen the Warrior, and Heiter the Priest. Their 10-year adventure concluded as they defeated the demon king and brought peace to the continent.

Frieren: Beyond Journey's End separates itself from other animated fantasy series by shifting the main focus on what lies after the journey as Frieren encounters meaningful meetings and departures.
